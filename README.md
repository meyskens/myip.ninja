MYIP.NINJA
==========

[myip.ninja](https://myip.ninja) is a very simple piece of code that gives you back your IP in plaintext for usage wherever you like like in bash scripts. myip.ninja can also give you specific IPs like [v4.myip.ninja](https://v4.myip.ninja) and [v6.myip.ninja](https://myip.ninja). myip.ninja works over both http and https.


### How to use 
```
#curl myip.ninja
  > 8.8.8.8
#curl v6.myip.ninja
  > aced:a11:7e57
```

### Why not use `insert local command here`
myip.ninja is used to detect your **External IP**, this can be handy when you're behind a NAT or when not even sure where the script will be used.

### Is it stable?
myip.ninja is developed for internal use at [SHOUTca.st](https://shoutca.st) where it has been in production use for years.

### How is it funded? Where are the ads?
myip.ninja is paid for by [SHOUTca.st](https://shoutca.st), We don't see such extreme use that we're not able to pay for it anymore. If you plan super heavy use we suggest hosting it yourself.
